## How to Run

1. **Run the algorithm:**
   - Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
   - In the terminal, execute the command: python run.py.
   
2. **Choose an algorithm:**
   - Type `1` for BFS (Breadth-First Search).
   - Type `2` for DFS (Depth-First Search).
   - Type `3` for IDFS (Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search).
   - Type `4` for Greedy Search.
   - Type `5` for A* Search (A-star).

2. **Choose an initial state:**
   - Type `1` for the initial state [[3, 4, 2], [5, 1, 7], [6, 0, 8]].
   - Type `2` for the initial state [[6, 2, 7], [5, 0, 3], [8, 1, 4]].
   - Type `3` to enter a custom initial state.

3. **(Optional) If choosing option `3`:**
   - Enter a custom initial state as a 3x3 matrix, separating the numbers by spaces.

The algorithm will run, displaying the result, including the execution time, maximum queue/stack size, the total number of generated nodes, and whether it found the solution, along with the depth of the found solution.
